### New Type Extensions
<br>

These settings enable you to define new types, expanding modding capabilities.

The game allows for a maximum of 255 types of each kind, inclusive of the ones included in the original game. Be careful not to over-extend it!

<table><tr><td width="50"><a href="#"><img title="New logic" src="./img/30x15/new.png"></a></td><td width="842"><samp>
<code>{Rules}</code> ► [BuildingTypes]
</samp></td><td width="120"><samp>List</samp></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><details><summary><b>View</b></summary>

This section carries a zero-based list of IDs to be recognized as new BuildingType.

Care must be taken that the list keys follow the zero-based index exactly. Duplicate keys (e.g. two '0='), or missing keys, may crash the game at boot. The requirement for strict ordering may change in the future.

Example as follows:

```ini
[BuildingTypes]
0=COMM
1=EYE
```
</details></td></tr></table>


<table><tr><td width="50"><a href="#"><img title="New logic" src="./img/30x15/new.png"></a></td><td width="842"><samp>
<code>{Rules}</code> ► [StringTableOffsets] ► Building
</samp></td><td width="120"><samp>Integer</samp></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><details><summary><b>View</b></summary>

The `Name` entries can be used to set the names of objects, but is limited to 30 across all instances before the game crashes. Instead, it is recommended to utilize `CONQUER.ENG` and its language counterparts to supply these names.

This specifies the string entry location within `CONQUER.ENG` of new technotype entries. The index used is denoted by [Type] + [index in the new types section] + 1.

For example, if `[StringTableOffsets] ► Building` is set to 400 and `[BuildingTypes] ► 2` is set to ATWR, then the string table entry for `[ATWR]` is 400 + 2 + 1 = **403**

Ensure that `CONQUER.ENG` has sufficient entries, as attempting to read a missing entry will crash the game when hovering over the affected unit.

Do not create entries that exceed 1000 as the game will route to `DEBUG.ENG` instead, which for now is beyond the scope of the project.

If not defined, or set to -1, all additional building types will default their names to the 'Civilian Building' text entry.

### Special Buildings
<br>

Some buildings are hardcoded to provide special logic. Some of them are unlocked here

Indicates that this building is a refinery and can be docked by Harvesters. The docking position is strictly the center cell of the building, with non-integer cell values rounded down, dictated by the `BSize` value. For example, the ore refinery center is the 2nd column, 2nd row of the building. Ensure the Harvester can reach this cell, otherwise the docking does not work.

Pips will also be drawn for player-owned, allied, or spied buildings to indicate the overall ore level relative to capacity.

```Exposed BuildingTypeClass->BSize```

Determines the size occupied by this building, not inclusive of the bib. This affects the placement of the image, but not the cells the building occupies. The following values are supported:

 > 0 = 1x1 (most base defenses)\
 > 1 = 2x1 (SAM Site)\
 > 2 = 1x2 (Tesla Coil, Gap Generator)\
 > 3 = 2x2 (Power Plant, Chronosphere)\
 > 4 = 2x3 (C&C Hand of Nod)\
 > 5 = 3x2 (War Factory, Airfield)\
 > 6 = 3x3 (Adv. Power Plant, Refinery)\
 > 7 = 4x2 (C&C Airfield)\
 > 8 = 5x5 
</details></td></tr></table>


There are two methods to customize building foundations. One may be easier to use than the other. The second one is kept for compatibility.

**Method 1**

Determines the combined occupy and visual overlap foundations for this building. Takes in a sequence of characters to move the cursor and build the foundation list.
Up to 640 occupancy 'X' cells and 640 overlay 'O' cells can be supported this way. Exceeding the limit may result in undefined behaviour, likely a crash.

The following characters are supported. Note that they are case sensitive.

 >The marking cursor starts at position (0,0), normally the top-left cell of the building\
 >\
 > The first row is aligned to the top of the image\
 > X denotes occupied, - denotes clear\
 > Example: A 2x3 grid is XXX|XXX\
 > Example: A 2x2 grid occupying one row above the image and the first row of the image is SXX|XX\
 >\
 > 'S' -> advances the cursor to the 1st column of the row above. This can be used to begin the sequence at the row above the  building's top-left corner (e.g. SAM Sites)\
 > '-' -> advances the cursor to the right\
 > 'X' -> marks the current location as (impassable) placement foundation, then advances the cursor to the right\
 > 'O' -> marks the current location as overlay tile (not part of the building foundation, but part of the object's refresh area, then advances the cursor to the right\
 > '|' -> marks a new line. advances the cursor to the 1st column of the row below\
 > Any other character terminates the sequence

```Exposed BuildingTypeClass->OccupyList```\
```Exposed BuildingTypeClass->OverlapList```

Determines the combinations of cells occupied by this building. The `OccupyList` determines cells that are not passable to ground units and is combined with the bib to determine the building outline for placement.

The `OverlapList` determines cells that are passable to ground units, and is used for proper image rendering.

The following values for both entries are supported. *Note that this syntax is experimental and is subject to change*:

Determines the Special Weapons that may be fired by this building. Note that some buildings require some animations to be enabled for the special weapon to work properly. Global overrides, such the Nuke being a fluke below TechLevel=10, still apply.

For a building with existing special weapons, they can be overriden (not appended) if SpecialWeapons is defined in ini.

The list of supported SpecialWeapons are:

<samp>

|SpecialWeapon |Explanation             
:--------------|:------------
|`SONARPULSE`  |The sonar pulse.<br>SpecialWeapons= has no affect due to the special spy requirements.
|`NUCLEARBOMB` |The nuke.<br>Requires the building to have the animations ACTIVE, AUX1 and AUX2 to create the actual Nuke.
|`CHRONOSPHERE`|The chrono warp.
|`PARABOMB`    |The parabomb.
|`PARAINFANTRY`|The paradrop.
|`SPYPLANE`    |The spy plane.
|`IRONCURTAIN` |The iron curtain effect.
|`GPS`         |The satellite launch.<br>Creates a GPS satellite animation at launch, which may look weird depending on the building you hook into.
</samp>

For example, `SpecialWeapons=GPS,SPYPLANE` grants both spy plane and GPS special powers while the building remains standing.

Allows the building to repack into the indicated unit. The controls to undeploy is the same as repacking an Construction Yard - give the building a move command.

The created building will be offset at the cell +1,+1 (directly south-east) from the building's top right cell. This may change in the future towards an automatic centering.

If defined, causes the building to explode like a Barrel, producing secondary explosions in its 4 cardinal directions. Determines the damage and warhead that is released on this building's destruction death. 
The barrel uses 200 damage / Fire warhead.

Note that the explosion center uses cell coordinates, which means a 2x2 building may generate the explosions around the top-left cell.

### AI AutoBase Controls
<br>

Each of the AutoBase controls are only effective the new AutoBase AI is enabled.
Enable it using [AI] ► UseNewBuildingAI. See <a href="./ai.md#base-building">AI Base Building</a> for more information

<table><tr><td width="50"><a href="#"><img title="New logic" src="./img/30x15/new.png"></a></td><td width="842"><samp>
<code>{Rules/Map}</code> ► [&lt;BuildingType&gt;]  ► AIBuildType
</samp></td><td width="120"><samp>String</samp></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><details><summary><b>View</b></summary>

Each building can be assigned one of several Prerequisite types. A total of 32 are supported, as below.

 > 0 = NONE\
 > 1 = POWER\
 > 2 = REFINERY\
 > 3 = BARRACKS\
 > 4 = WARFACTORY\
 > 5 = TECH\
 > 6 = DEFENSE\
 > 7 = ADV.DEFENSE\
 > 8 = AA.DEFENSE\
 > 9 = AIRSTRIP\
 > 10 = HELIPAD\
 > 11 = GENERIC

NONE effectively excludes the building from being considered by the new autobase AI

Defaults to the following values, depending on the building in question:
 > POWER: [POWR], [APWR]\
 > REFINERY: [PROC]\
 > BARRACKS: [BARR], [TENT]\
 > WARFACTORY: [WEAP]\
 > DEFENSE: [PBOX], [HBOX], [GUN], [FTUR]\
 > ADV.DEFENSE: [TSLA]\
 > AA.DEFENSE: [AGUN], [SAM]\
 > TECH: [KENN], [DOME], [FIX], [ATEK], [STEK], [GAP], [IRON], [PDOX], [MSLO]\
 > AIRSTRIP: [AFLD]\
 > HELIPAD: [HPAD]\
 > GENERIC: [SILO]\
 > NONE: All other buildings

</samp></td><td width="120"><samp>Integer</samp></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><details><summary><b>View</b></summary>
 
Determines the maximum number of building instances that the new AutoBase AI can build, after accounting for all other checks (i.e. Limit / Ratio) 
Defaults to 10 for [SILO], 0 for all else.
If the value is 0, the AutoBase AI will treat the value as:
 - 1 (for `AIBuildType`=TECH)
 - Unlimited otherwise

To disable the building from being built by the AutoBase AI, use `AIBuildType`=NONE instead

The AI may have a need to sell structures to control their money or power situation. The selection of buildings used to be hardcoded. Now they are available for configuration.

Use the values 1 - 4 to determine at which urgency level the building is permitted to be sold. Lower value means that the building can be sold when the situation is less urgent, and higher values prevents the AI from selling the building at low urgency, reserving the control for greater emergencies.

Use the value 0 to prevent the AI from selling it to recover power or money. The AI may still sell the structure by other means (e.g. when damaged to red health via `IQ` ► `Sellback`)

NONE effectively excludes the building from being considered by the new autobase AI

Defaults to the following values, depending on the building in question:
<b>AILowPowerSellPriority</b>
 > 1: [ATEK], [PDOX], [STEK], [SYRD], [SPEN], [FCOM]\
 > 2: [IRON], [DOME], [FIX]\
 > 3: [TSLA]\
 > 0 (disabled): All other buildings

<b>AILowMoneySellPriority</b>
 > 1: [ATEK], [PDOX], [SILO], [STEK], [FIX], [SYRD], [SPEN], [FCOM]\
 > 2: [HPAD], [TSLA]\
 > 3: [AFLD], [POWR]\
 > 4: [FACT]\
 > 0 (disabled): All other buildings
